# CSC209-Software-Tools-and-Systems-Programming
UofT CSC209H1 2022W Assignments

## A1: use some of C skills including functions, loops and arrays on problems involving DNA sequences

## A2: this assignment is not about writing a program to solve the game Wordle.  Instead we are going to produce a tree that contains all of the possible paths to a solution given the solution word, and the grid of coloured tiles that will impose constraints on the potential paths, and then print all of the possible paths to a solution.

## A3: write the back-end of the server -- the part that produces the content of a web page. In assignment 4 you will add the networking code so that you can retrieve web pages from your server using a conventional browser as a client.

## A4: extend the program from assignment 3 to communicate with a client over sockets, and to allow multiple simultaneous clients using select.
